# This file is for customizing the configuation process performed by
# `./configure'.  This file consists of sh(1) variable-definition lines.
# The value given to those variable by this file will override their
# default values.
#
# Alternatively, You can customize the configuration process via the
# environment variables seen by ./configure.  For example:
#
#     In csh(1):
#         % setenv PERL /usr/local/bin/perl
#         % ./configure
#
#     In sh(1):
#         $ PERL=/usr/local/bin/perl ./configure
#
# Variables in this file override the environmental ones.
